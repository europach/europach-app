At the same time, the security ethos demands to prohibit drugs inside prisons to enable abstinence among prisoners, and to deprive the delinquent of any privileges. Wardens and prison authorities are faced with this contradiction when asked to provide sterile syringes to inmates and thus implicitly tolerate drug use."

However, due to their demonstrable success in reducing needle sharing, step by step syringe exchange programmes get officially tolerated as an effective public health measure. And gradually, more and more drug help organisations start to offer syringe distribution. So it is through actions of civil disobedience and subsequent negotiations on the local level that new and successful social realities are created, and a more liberal approach to drug used becomes imaginable."

After Der Lichtblick scandalised this decision, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) initiates a debate in parliament in which the party Alternative Liste (today: Die Grünen/the Green Party) suggests to provide free condoms and syringes inside Berlin's prisons. This suggestion is rejected by the governing parties. Concerning the condoms, the Senator argues that he had never heard of a prisoner who demands condoms. Michael Gähner, editor in chief of the prisoner journal Der Lichtblick and later policy advisor at Deutsche AIDS-Hilfe criticises this de-sexualisation of the prison, as well as the politicians´ decision to expose the prisoners to a high risk of HIV infection through needle sharing."

Drug use is not only prohibited inside prisons due to security and legal reasons. It is also prosecuted in the name of the dominant therapeutic aim of total drug abstinence. In his letter to the attorney general of Bremen, the prisoner expresses the difficulties of a drug-free life inside prison. Boredom, isolation, desolation, lack of social contacts, loneliness and depression make it nearly impossible to stay abstinent. He states: \"I am addicted, I am not cured from my addiction just locked away.\" Since drugs and syringes are circulating inside the prison anyways, the confiscation would not stop him from consuming drugs but increase the risk of getting \"punished with a deadly virus\". He claims that the attorney general enacts an inconsistent legal stance towards drugs when tolerating the distribution of syringes outside the prison, but prosecuting it inside. This argument seems to point to the principle of equivalence that, although recommended by international governing bodes, has not entered into national legislation yet."

The provision of sterile syringes to prisoners is very cautiously suggested. This policy exemplifies how a public health concern enables a more humane approach to drugs.

In this report the CPT will define basic principles for prison health care: access to a doctor, equivalence of care, patient consent and confidentiality, preventive healthcare, humanitarian assistance, professional independence, and professional competence. Whereas in 1998 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe will issue Recommendation No R (98) 7 concerning The Ethical and Organizational Aspects of Health Care in Prison in which they adopt the principle of equivalence.

After learning about the Swiss project and later about the pilot projects in Lower Saxony, Berlin and Hamburg, he strongly advocates for a syringe exchange in Hessen, drafts a detailed proposal together with a legal expert, and presents it to the Ministry of Justice of Hessen. The Minister supports the idea. But at a meeting of the union of penitentiary employees (germ. Bund der Strafvollzugsbediensteten Deutschlands) prison employees express their anxiety. According to Weyl, they fear that syringes could be used as weapons. Thus, the Minister refuses to act against the will of prison employees and stops the project."

The Senator explains that although an internal group of experts has recommended syringe exchange programmes, the government had decided otherwise.

The Members of Parliament debate about the proposal controversially. The Green Party combines different logics when arguing for syringe exchange. It refers to the amendment of the Narcotic Substances Act that legalises the distribution of syringes, and thus conquers legal concerns. The party points to the recommendations of the final report of the Enquetekommission and reminds the parliament of the public health concern of preventing the transmission of HIV. They further argue that there has so far been no evidence for any attack using needles as weapons against prison employees. Mobilising evidence should help to render the fear of potential attacks irrational. And by reminding the parliament of the lawsuit recently filed by a prisoner who got infected with the virus while sharing needles in prison, the party addresses the issue of citizenship rights to equivalent health care in prison."

Other parliamentarians argue that the provision of syringes would create a moral dilemma, since the state and the penitentiary are obliged to prosecute drug possession, and to work toward a drug-free prison, as well as to enable abstinence among drug users. Finally, the Senator of Justice declares her willingness to consult further evidence and expertise. Afterwards she would be willing to consider a small-scale pilot project."

In an open letter, Backes explains that since he had regularly been tested and never had any homosexual contacts, his infection could only result from needle sharing during his time of imprisonment. He refers to the statement of the federal Minister of Justice, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, in which she argued that there has been no evidential proof of an increased risk of HIV transmission within the prison setting. Backes now claims that his case can provide clear evidence. Therefore, in order to fulfil the minister's promise to undertake all steps necessary to prevent transmission she would now have to allow needle exchange programmes inside prisons."

Advocates for prison health and harm reduction point to the positive evaluations of both programmes, and criticise that there is neither proof for the concerns raised nor any technical need to end the programmes. Instead, they attribute the decision to political will ignoring scientific reasoning. Heino Stöver, who together with colleagues conducted the scientific evaluation of the project (Meyenberg 1998), concludes that a particular political ideology mobilises prison and prison health as a popular domain for punishment, prosecution and penitentiary. Social exclusion needs to be publicly exercised in order to avoid any sign of well-being, benefits or even hedonism for prisoners."

They point to the high risk of HIV and HVC transmission through the increasing number of prisoners from Eastern Europe – a region with an \"alarming\" growth of HIV infections among drug users. At the same time, they criticise the prison authorities' lack of openness to the project. Besides the AIDS service organisation, the Justizvollzugsbeirat, Deutsche AIDS-Hilfe, as well as the Green Party advocate for prolonging the project. The scientific report also evaluates the project as effectively displaying the decrease of risk behaviour, and a very low rate of new infections. Furthermore, the two prison administrations report about their experiences. The report from the women's prison is short and positive. The report from the men's prison points to several difficulties related to the specific implementation: Since this prison had formerly been nearly drug free, the staff was not prepared to deal with the new prisoners who inject drugs, neither was the architecture of the building prepared to prevent drug trafficking. The report opts against the prolonging of the project."

The BGB defines rights between private persons and is thus to be distinguished from public law. Together with its statutory texts (ex. commonhold property law, the insurance contract act, the life partnership law, general equal treatment act), it constitutes the general private law. The general private law is extended through special civil laws, which establish unique terms of regulation for particular subject areas or professional groups, such as commercial law or collective bargaining laws for merchants. At the same time, aside from an annex, the BGB does not offer a comprehensive codification of civil law."

These associations viewed HIV and AIDS primarily from epidemiological and medical perspectives. The social dimensions of the epidemic became of greater relevance in the associations’ work only in later years, when their active doctors would also be confronted with the experiences of discrimination of their HIV and AIDS patients, and therefore recognised a need for action in their social spheres (see Çetin, Zülfukar (2017): Intertwined Movements, Interwoven Histories: HIV and AIDS in Turkey.

In this interview, Dr. Badur was was asked whether HIV is curable and about the routes of transmission. Background for this interview was that Sevgi Ulukaya was infected with HIV through unprotected sexual contact with her former husband, Ümit Ulukaya, which is why he was initially sentenced. He was defended by his lawyer with the argument that his infection was regularly monitored and his virus load was below the detection limit, which meant that he could not transmit the virus to others.  He thus wanted to make clear that HIV could to some extent be cured. At the same time, the lawyer argued that he should not be put in prison because treatment would still be necessitated but not be guaranteed there. In this interview, Selim Badur informed that the virus level could be reduced so much so as to be rendered undetectable, but that the virus forever remains in the person’s blood"

It has made a number of decisions marking a new stage in the enlargement process. Steps have also been taken to ensure that the Union itself will have effective, reformed institutions, a strengthened common security and defence policy, and a competitive, job-generating, sustainable economy. The European Council welcomed recent positive developments in Turkey as noted in the Commission's progress report, as well as its intention to continue its reforms towards complying with the Copenhagen criteria. Turkey was a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States. Building on the existing European strategy, Turkey, like other candidate States, was to benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. This included enhanced political dialogue, with emphasis on progressing towards fulfilling the political criteria for accession with particular reference to the issue of human rights, as well as on the issues referred to in paragraphs 4 and 9(a). Turkey would also have the opportunity to participate in Community programmes and agencies and in meetings between candidate States and the Union in the context of the accession process. An accession partnership was to be drawn up on the basis of previous European Council conclusions while containing priorities on which accession preparations must concentrate in the light of the political and economic criteria and the obligations of a Member State, combined with a national programme for the adoption of the acquis. Appropriate monitoring mechanisms were to be established. With a view to intensifying the harmonisation of Turkey's legislation and practice with the acquis, the Commission was invited to prepare a process of analytical examination of the acquis. The European Council asked the Commission to present a single framework for coordinating all sources of European Union financial assistance for pre-accession (see http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/hel1_en.htm)"

Over the course of the first few years, the group gained support from activists, medical doctors, and people working within UNAIDS. The first activities of the association were organised through an electronic mailing list entitled “HIV POZITIF”, which also served to enable networking among HIV-positive people. This was especially important for those who did not live in Istanbul and therefore were unable to obtain vital information on the ground. The mailing list also served as a kind of safer space where HIV-positive people could empower themselves. In this mailing list, the participants exchanged their experiences as people living with HIV, and were therefore exposed to different forms of discrimination and stigma. Through this exchange of experiences, one can assume that they supported each other and built a collective awareness of emancipatory self-organization. In 2004, some participants in this list decided to establish an association for and by HIV-positive people. Since that year, it was possible for almost all groups in the population to establish their own associations or to gain institutional status in the form of an organization. Thus, the Pozitif Yaşam Derneği association was founded in Istanbul in June 2005. The organisation has indicated that a diagnosis with HIV is often seen to inhibit the possibility of exercising military service."

Kompot became highly popular in Central and Eastern Europe because of the fact that poppies were rather easily available and relatively inexpensive. As Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch (2013) states, in the end of the 1970s 90% of patients in Poland, hospitalized for drug dependency, were using kompot. At that time “drug abusers” were treated primarily in psychiatric facilities, what helped to shape a perception of drug issue as a medical problem. This way of framing drug use was later radically changed (in the 1990s) due to introduction of criminal law to drug regulations."

The regulation situated Poland among countries with a rather liberal approach towards personal possession due to the fact that it concerned primarily drug production and sale. At that time the main illicit substance used by drug users in injections was a homemade poppy-based product (kompot, also called Polish heroin). The drug became popular among young people already in the 1970s, but didn’t not receive any serious policy response. Accorfing to the new law, personal possession was not criminalized, but production, supplies and sales were penalized.  Such a liberal approach towards drug possession could be related to a general more liberal atmosphere in Poland (e.g. evoked by the Solidarity movement in the 1980s) or to the anti-American position of the Polish authorities during the Cold War. It was the first legal act in the Polish context that defined terms “addiction” or “addicted person”. The law provided also the foundations for medical and social care for people who use drugs – public healthcare centers responsible for treatment could cooperate with NGOs and Church-related initiatives, what was rather unexpected in the communist context."

The transformation also signaled the opening of borders, thus enabling international cooperation centered around HIV. It also resulted in the restoration of the freedom of association and development of civil society. Although for many people the social and economic changes related to the transition have been adventitious in terms of economic stability and social stratification, as well as for pursuing individual careers, within Polish society there were also vulnerable groups, for whom transformation meant a reduction in quality of life, an increase in poverty, and a lack of stability (Malinowska-Sempruch, 2013). The landscape of drug use was radically reconstructed by modernization processes taking place in Poland after 1989. Opening borders in 1989 also influenced the illicit drug market and new substances became available (e.g. amphetamine, cannabis, LSD, ecstasy). The cultivation of poppies become illegal in 1990 (a special permission from the authorities was required for cultivation)."

The model has been soon recognized by the state authorities as the right approach what translated itself into financial support for MONAR.  The organization was the biggest beneficiary of the public funds for drug dependency treatment. The association introduced syringe program in the late 1980s., but for a while it was not accepted by the whole organization, causing internal conflicts and tensions. The harm reduction approach was officially adopted by MONAR in 1995, but the first branch that introduced harm reduction approach and services was located in Kraków. The interviewees described the local branch from Kraków as the community with somehow separate ideas and a new approach toward drug use, based on human rights."

Among projects supported by the programs were: drop-in centre in Kraków, methadone program in Zgorzelec, needle & syringe exchange, street working, social events for people living with HIV,  workshops and conferences."

Such reflection was provoked on the one hand by transformations of the illicit drug market, and on the other by the 1994 ratification of the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic In Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Stasiowski 2009). Another reason for seeing the previous act insufficient could be high rates of HIV infections documented among people who use drugs. Such thought was expressed in a social anti-drug campaign led by a centrist politician - Barbara Labuda under the slogan “Better in prison, than in a cemetery” (Malinowska-Sempruch 2013). The 1985 act was also seen as an unwanted heritage from the previous regime. Another explanation of making drug regulations more restrictive was given by one of the interviewees, who claimed undeniable influence of the American diplomacy on local policy-makers (R10)."

As a result of these discussions, the 1997 Drug Abuse Prevention Act was passed with votes from all parliamentary parties. It made personal possession illegal, but allowed to suspend penalties in this matter. It criminalized possession in general, but de-penalized possessing drugs for own consumption (Kuźmicz et al., 2009). What is important here is the fact that “personal possession” was not defined – in every case police, prosecutors and judges had to decide separately. In practice, although the new law gave law enforcement agencies power to penalize drug use, they avoided to prosecute and penalize petty drug consumption. Although the legal solution was presented as modern and based on common sense (European Monitoring…, 2014, p.9), it also started a new path of thinking about drug use – since then it was framed as a legal/criminal issue (Malinowska-Sempruch 2013). The 1997 act was the beginning of further changes towards more restrictive anti-drug regulations. One of the interviewees mentioned that from her perspective the end of 1990s in Poland meant a certain shift towards the conservative social and political climate, in which “those without political power” (and their rights) were abandoned by the state.

Władek, who initiated the mobilization in 2007, to receive buprenorphine had to travel to Kraków (located almost 600 km south of Gdańsk) or acquire the drug illegally, which ipso facto could criminalise his therapy. His home town – Gdańsk, one of the largest Polish cities – had offered only abstinence long-term programs for opioid-type substance dependencies. Władek wrote a letter demanding access to substitution treatment, which became viral and reached the President of Gdańsk and the Parliamentary Committee on Health, among others. In his request, Władek demanded respect for patient rights and access to harm reduction by demonstrating his vulnerable position (being  sick, without access to substitution treatment) but also expressed his resistance towards existing living conditions of people who use drugs, criminalization of their behaviors and inequalities in access to healthcare. Together with his friends decided to run an association aiming at promoting harm reduction approach in the region and offering mutual help for people who use drugs. Their story was broadly discussed in media."

As one of the respondents stated, the report was “shocking” to many policy-makers and activists: [this study] really set off an avalanche, maybe avalanche is too much to say, but the study moved the drug policy further, because without this research nobody would care about it, I think (R10)."

        "content": "Krajewski indicated in his study that since 2000 Poland experienced an alarming increase of arrests in drug possession. While at the beginning of the 21st century a number of arrests was ca. 2000, six years later over 30000 people were arrested for drug possession (Malinowska-Sempruch 2013, 56-57). Furthermore, it has shown that 60% of all arrests was an outcome of the routine police work among young people, and only 20% were the result of special police operations  (Krajewski 2008). This suggested that police instead of focusing on drug trafficking, was improving the statistics by arresting petty consumers. In 55% of cannabis possession cases and almost 60% of amphetamines’ possessing the amount of drugs was less than 1 gram (Ibid.). Another important finding from the study indicated that 76% of defendants did not have a lawyer while negotiating with the prosecutor, what could suggest serious human rights violations. The discussion about the findings has shown that the drug regulations missed their primarily goals and did not reduce drug trafficking. The law also did not discourage young people from using drugs, as it was intended to, but only changed the pattern of drug use. The study was also exceptional, because it drew attention of politicians and policy-makers to the social consequences of the drug law  (R10). Another very influential study, conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs (Instytut Spraw Publicznych) more or less at the same time, has shown similar data and recommended several changes in drug law and policies (Kuźmicz, Mielecka-Kubień, Wiszejko-Wierzbicka 2009). Both studies provoked a 2-years debate on the one hand on social consequences of the 2000 regulations, and on the need of liberalization of the drug law on the other hand. It was the first moment that mobilized to such an extent both sides: liberal/leftist and right-wing media and communities."

Americas Watch was founded in 1981 while bloody civil wars engulfed Central America… In rapid succession in the 1980s, Asia Watch (1985), Africa Watch (1988), and Middle East Watch (1989) were added to what was then known as ‘The Watch Committees’.” “In 1988, the organization formally adopted the all-inclusive name Human Rights Watch….Human Rights Watch broadened and strengthened its work on the rights of women, children, refugees, and migrant workers, bringing a human rights perspective to such issues as domestic violence, trafficking, rape as a war crime, and child soldiers… It helped spotlight previously ignored topics such as the rights of gays and lesbians. The 21st century has brought new challenges. The September 11, 2001 attacks and their aftermath highlighted the need for new forms of pressure on terrorist groups and their supporters and close monitoring of counterterrorism laws, policies, and practices that infringe upon basic human rights. The HIV/AIDS pandemic led to the creation of a Human Rights Watch program devoted to human rights and health. Human Rights Watch is increasingly applying its research methodology to economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly in the areas of education and housing.” These excerpts were taken from a presentation of the organisation’s history, which is available on its website and through the link accompanying this entry.\n"

Surveillance is based on the mandatory notification system, the system of laboratory reporting, the sentinel surveillance systems and several specialized laboratory networks.”"

The organisation was also initially part of the Inter-Ministerial Plan for Combating Addictions, and met regularly with representatives of European-level institutions, including European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and WHO Europe, to determine and assess strategies for responding to the documented outbreak. Data from KEELPNO contradicted claims made by the Minister of Health at an UNGASS meeting just prior to the testing and arrests. Not without critical dissent from within the organisation, representatives of KEELPNO conducted forced HIV testing in relation to the events presented here, published research assessing the public response to these initiatives, and was thus also the target of a lawsuit brought against the implicated public servants. A subsequent president of the organisation ultimately apologised for the rights-violations without any further action."

NSWP is a membership organisation. Our members are local, national or regional sex worker-led organisations and networks across five regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America and the Caribbean. NSWP’s work is based on three core values: Acceptance of sex work as work; Opposition to all forms of criminalisation and other legal oppression of sex work (including sex workers, clients, third parties, families, partners and friends); Supporting self-organisation and self-determination of sex workers.” “A group of sex workers’ rights activists working in sex work projects around the world started networking in 1990 at the 2nd International Conference for NGOs working on AIDS in Paris. Two years later, NSWP was formally launched as an alliance of sex workers’ rights activists and sex work projects during the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Over the years, NSWP has conducted activities in partnership with other organisations, and has influenced policy and built leadership among sex workers and facilitated the development of regional and national networks of sex workers and sex work projects. NSWP questioned the stigma of sex work and advocated for the greater recognition of sex workers as rights bearers, with the capacity to make a difference.” “NSWP, along with its regional networks, was also successful in urging UNAIDS to reconsider its 2007 policy guidelines on HIV and sex work.” For more information on the organisation, visit the accompanying link.

Three priority lines of action for AIDS Action Europe were defined: Addressing the rise of HIV and STIs in Western Europe; Supporting an effective response to HIV and AIDS in Central and Eastern Europe; Advocating for sufficient resource mobilisation for the global epidemic. In reality AIDS Action Europe has focused in its further actions mostly on the first two lines of action and has supported other actors in the field, when necessary, on action line number three.” More information on the network is available through the linked website."

The core aim of ICRSE is to ensure that the voices of sex workers in the region are heard, listened to and respected. We strive to raise awareness about the social exclusion of female, male and transgender sex workers in Europe and Central Asia; to promote the human, health and labour rights of all sex workers at community, national and regional level; and to build alliances with key partners, including sex workers and their organisations globally, NGOs and other civil society organisations and key stakeholders at the level of EU policy and decision-making. ICRSE opposes all forms of criminalisation of sex work and strongly disputes the conflation of sex work with trafficking. We aim to raise awareness of the harmful impact of the conflation of sex work with trafficking on sex workers’ lives and seek to put forward a labour rights’ perspective of sex work, whereby the labour, health and human rights of all sex workers are recognised, protected and fulfilled by national, regional and international laws, policies and programmes.” More information on the Committee is available through the accompanying link."

It reads: “In some countries, criminal law is being applied to those who transmit or expose others to HIV infection. There are no data indicating that the broad application of criminal law to HIV transmission will achieve either criminal justice or prevent HIV transmission. Rather, such application risks undermining public health and human rights. Because of these concerns, UNAIDS urges governments to limit criminalization to cases of intentional transmission i.e. where a person knows his or her HIV positive status, acts with the intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it. In other instances, the application of criminal law should be rejected by legislators, prosecutors and judges. In particular, criminal law should not be applied to cases where there is no significant risk of transmission or where the person: did not know that s/he was HIV positive; did not understand how HIV is transmitted;disclosed his or her HIV-positive status to the person at risk (or honestly believed the other person was aware of his/her status through some other means); did not disclose his or her HIV-positive status because of fear of violence or other serious negative consequences; took reasonable measures to reduce risk of transmission, such as practising safer sex through using a condom or other precautions to avoid higher risk acts; or previously agreed on a level of mutually acceptable risk with the other person.” (UNAIDS 2008: 1) The full Brief is available through the accompanying link."

For this purpose Positive Voice has long created a position for advocacy and communication thus investing in that position.” Central methods include: the empowerment of people living with HIV, the provision of non-clinical prevention, education and testing for bloodborne conditions, and outreach to persons in prisons, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and, most recently through the newly developed Red Umbrella Athens project, also to sex workers.

Suicide and homicide mortality rates among men increased by 22.7% and 27.6%, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, and mental disorders, substance abuse, and infectious disease morbidity showed deteriorating trends during 2010 and 2011.

        "content": "In November 2010, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) published a guidance report on HIV testing entitled “HIV testing: increasing uptake and effectiveness in the European Union”, which was in effect at the time of the core events of this story. The guidelines read: “It is recognised that the countries of Europe currently vary widely in their political and social approaches to HIV but to ensure that a national HIV testing strategy takes an ethical  approach based on human rights, countries need to adhere to the following principles. As far as possible, these principles are based on evidence, but in some cases they are aspirational and have their basis in accepted best practice and expert consensus. HIV testing should be voluntary, confidential and undertaken with informed consent. A national HIV testing strategy must primarily serve the needs of those who are infected and as yet undiagnosed. People must be able to choose to test for their own benefit rather than be coerced or compelled, even where this would be deemed to be in the interests of the wider public health. Their decision to test must be based on informed consent. Confidentiality is a fundamental principle of all healthcare and is of particular importance to HIV testing. Fear of a breach of confidentiality will deter individuals from seeking HIV testing or accepting it when it is offered. In Europe, the communities most affected by HIV are socially marginalised and this, combined with HIV-related stigma, can create a barrier to HIV testing. Services therefore need to be designed in such a way that members of those communities can come forward without fear of reprisal or blame. This is best achieved by making HIV testing available in a wide range of settings, both medical and non-medical, delivered by appropriately trained and competent staff. There should be clear referral pathways to, and support from, HIV specialist services.” (ECDC 2010: 2-3) The full guidance report is available through the accompanying link."

It was also referenced in the claims brought to the Greek justice system against the public authorities involved in these events, and in the related cases brought to the European Court of Human Rights against the Greek government."

These conditions significantly influence the risk for communicable disease outbreaks.” Simultaneously, the ECDC mission report encouraged the Greek government to introduce measures to surveil migrants’ health conditions: “[t]o ensure that the current early warning component of the surveillance of communicable diseases of migrants is strengthened, standardised reporting of selected clinical syndromes using case definitions should be considered”. Several interviewees suggested that this recommendation might have contributed to a subsequent amendment to the immigration law per presidential decree: On 11 of April, the immigration law provision, law 4075/11.04.2012, amended article 13 of Presidential Decree 114/2010 on the “establishment of a single procedure for granting the status of refugee or of beneficiary of subsidiary protection to aliens or to stateless persons in conformity with Council Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (Law 326/13.12.2005)” allowing for health screening of undocumented migrants."

During that meeting, the HCDCP informed all the directors of the country's Infectious Diseases Units, along with directors of AIDS Reference Centres, as well as the leadership of the Organisation against Drugs (Greek acronym: OKANA) and the NGOs operating in the field of HIV. ‘We are facing a new epidemiological phenomenon and everyone's assistance and effort will be indispensable,’ according to the then member of the Management Board of the HCDCP and now director of the Infectious Diseases Units of the Hospital RED CROSS.” (Kloka 2014, 1) “The first annual epidemiological assessment of the situation after the first outbreak of the epidemic among IDUs, showed an annual increase of positive HIV diagnoses in people who inject drugs by almost 1500% in 2011.” (ibid. 2) "

This documented outbreak provoked a series of meetings with European governing bodies to evaluate and advise on the situation, and may have contributed to the subsequent Minister's speech at the UNGASS meeting and decree even as this data did not seem to inform the content of either. It ultimately led to the creation of a program designed to test people who use drugs for HIV with their consent, and then refer them to institutions of care. The documented outbreak was a reference point in a workshop on Greek legal structures and HIV, in a film about the events recounted here, and may have been a factor that contributed to the formation of the first organisation of people who use drugs in Greece."

Our basic objective was to ensure access to public health services. Currently, all people in need can receive medical and hospital treatment, even if they lack the means for it, even if they are poor, uninsured, financial or illegal immigrants. Another priority of ours was to protect human rights and promote actions against discrimination. Through campaigns in schools, the army, prisons and elsewhere, through blood safety controls we seek to strengthen prevention.” “our main concern is the scourge of human trafficking. We had a significant increase of recorded AIDS infections last year. Many of these infections concern women from the sub-Saharan Africa, who have been brought to the country illegally and they were forced to work as prostitutes.” "

This rapid risk assessment confirmed the significant increase in HIV case reports among people who inject drugs in Greece and identified a temporal association with low levels of HIV prevention coverage. The rapid risk assessment recommended an increased focus on prevention programmes, including needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution treatment, combined with enhanced testing and treatment.” (ECDC Athens May 2012, 2) “It is important to note that all reports that ensued the visits of the European institutions, namely ECDC, EMCDDA and WHO-EUROPE, made particular reference to coordination issues, in which they found a large deficit. Special emphasis is given, whenever is possible, to the assumption of political responsibility at every level (the engagement of the local government and several Ministries -with the exception of the Ministry of Health- is not strong). Emphasis is also given the importance of harm reduction interventions in prison, as the number of people who are in prison for offenses connected to drug use reaches 50% of the total prison population.” (Kloka 2014, 7-8) “A risk assessment performed in November 2011 by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) documented an increase in newly detected HIV cases among people who inject drugs in Greece and Romania.” (EMCDDA 2012, Agenda from 2nd joint expert meeting in Lisbon) Report from risk assessment is available in link."

A key provision was included in this National Plan, according to which OKANA should receive financing from the Ministry of Health in order to create, inter alia, new Substitution Treatment Units.” (Kloka 2014, 6) “Initial Distribution Network: HCDCP and NGOs (Doctors of the World, Positive Voice, Centre for Life, PR.A.K.S.I.S.), as well as  of workers and volunteers in steretwork, with the aim of ensuring the distribution of material to active IDUs in the centre of Athens.” OKANA “sent a request to the Ministry of Health and eventually received funding, in order to...create and prepare a distribution network with the participation of the HCDCP and NGOs (DOCTORS OF THE WORLD, POSITIVE VOICE, CENTRE FOR LIFE, PR.A.K.S.I.S.), as well as of workers and volunteers in streetwork...Streetwork officially began in February 2012. Almost at the same period, the HCDCP withdrew from the partnership, although its logo had been printed on the package, and went on to create its own sanitary material package. The reasons for this withdrawal have still not been explained by the board or management of the organisation.” (ibid. 2) “The implementation of the plan coincided with the increase in HIV diagnoses among injecting drug users in 2011 (several diagnoses were perhaps recorded during the examinations that drug users were subjected to upon their admission to substitution programs). The creation of these new units resulted in the abolition of waiting lists across the country; more specifically, in Attica, where the largest volume of demand was to be found, waiting time was reduced from 7.5 years to 42 months. The above mentioned situation is described with great clarity in the biennial OKANA Assessment Report on the 2010-2012 Activities, published in March 2012.” (ibid., 6) Through this plan, KEELPNO outreach workers were sent into the streets to conduct HIV tests in the same vans that were used to forcibly test women in April and May of 2012."

At least two excerpts from this note anticipate the events that were to unfold in Greece in the coming months: “Many countries criminalise HIV transmission and exposure. These laws are often unevenly applied, but sex workers are particularly vulnerable to charges under these laws, which in many cases do not correspond to UN guidelines. In addition, male and transgender sex workers are disproportionately vulnerable to criminal charges in places where sex between men and transgender are criminalised.” (UNAIDS 2012: 4)  “States should move away from criminalising sex work or activities associated with it. Decriminalisation of sex work should include removing criminal laws and penalties for purchase and sale of sex, management of sex workers and brothels, and other activities related to sex work. To the degree that states retain non-criminal administrative law or regulations concerning sex work, these should be applied in ways that do not violate sex workers’ rights or dignity and that ensure their enjoyment of due process of law.” (UNAIDS 2012: 6) The entire guidance note is available through the accompanying link.\n"

Interviewees grasped this policy shift together with the provision 39a as a coordinated strategy to bolster fear within Greek society, and to create a division between good Greek citizens and threatening “others.” In the context of the pre-election period and the financial crisis, this was thought to have created an impression that these government pursuits of perceived threats from within Greek society were necessary, and to have helped garner support for the governing socialist party."

Legislative change in Greece under Amendment 4075/11.04.2012 has allowed for the detention of ‘irregular’ migrants if they are deemed by immigration authorities to pose a threat to public health security for a period of up to ninety days or a maximum of 180 pending deportation (Open Access Now! 2013). Individuals may be detained on the grounds that they are suspected of suffering from an infectious disease, belonging to groups with infectious diseases, or living in conditions that do not meet the minimum standards of hygiene (Human Rights Watch 2012). On arrest, ‘irregular’ migrants are required to undergo a series of medical tests involving both a questionnaire about their medical histories and an invasive clinical examination.” (Vaughan-Williams 2015: 94)"

The letter read: “Forcible testing is a violation of bodily integrity and autonomy. The UN’s expert health agencies have affirmed that HIV testing should only be done with informed consent, meaning testing must be both informed and voluntary; furthermore, testing should be accompanied by pre- and post-test counselling and the confidentiality of test results should be guaranteed…The European Court of Human Rights Judgment (18 October 2011, nr. 16188/07) in the case of a French woman classified as a “prostitute” for five years in Geneva police database, has sentenced that it was a violation of article 8, the right to respect for private life.“ the Court concluded that the storage in the police records of allegedly false data concerning her private life had breached Ms Khelili’s right to respect for her private life and considered that the retention of the word “prostitute” for years was neither justified nor necessary in a democratic society.”"

They are discriminatory and in complete contradiction with all international and EU treaties that Greece has ratified. They are archaic since they are only a new version of the Contagious Diseases Acts implemented during Victorian Britain. They are also completely counterproductive in terms of HIV prevention and the opposite of all recommendations made in the fight against HIV. The scapegoating of sex workers is not going to stop new infections, but only worsen the stigma and discriminations against sex workers and people living with HIV. The mandatory testing and the outing of sex workers living with HIV is only contributing to more distrust with medical institutions and sex workers avoiding access to medical care, when they should instead feel encouraged and respected. If sex workers ignore their status and avoid medical care, they won’t be able to access treatments which can improve their health and reduce the risk of new infection. The new climate of paranoia and fear will only discourage people to get tested and to disclose their status. It will force sex workers living with HIV to hide and to accept unsafe sex to avoid suspicion, and it will encourage clients to ask for unprotected sex thinking that sex workers are tested for their own safety.”"

It read: “Transgender Europe (TGEU) is highly worried about the recent systematic human rights violations against sex workers in Greece…Many trans women are sex workers and TGEU has been informed that trans sex workers have also been subjected to the screening and exposure. Further similar screenings are announced for the next couple of weeks…Forcefully subjecting a person to HIV testing, violates their bodily integrity, autonomy and free choice of health care. We strongly condemn the intentional violation of privacy by the police in its intend to “punish” those living with HIV by publishing their identities. This is not only contradictory to any public health standards but poses a direct threat to the individuals’ safety and security. Greek authorities have violated European and international human rights standards they have signed up to, including ICCPR (Article 17), ICESCR (Article 12) and ECHR (Article 8) which all guarantee respect for private life, prohibit arbitrary interference to a person’s privacy and obliges states to respect human dignity. Moreover, Greece signed up to the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers LGBT recommendation (2010(5)) to promote equality and non-discrimination of all transgender persons in Greece.”  "

Signatories of the press release stated: “As part of a Government authorised crackdown on hundreds of unlicensed brothels around Greece, sex workers are being arrested, submitted to forced HIV testing and facing criminal charges without recourse to due process, as well as being publically identified in the media. As a result of these actions women are to face prosecution on charges of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm merely because they are HIV positive. There is no proof of exposure or transmission to others nor is it clear that any of these women knew their HIV status prior to this test. They are facing further charges for misdemeanours related to alleged illegal prostitution. These actions of the Greek Police and the Ministry of Health and KEELPNO violate fundamental human rights. They also contravene fundamental public health principles of informed consent and voluntary access to services.”"

The document read: “Amnesty International believes that the measures adopted by the Greek authorities are completely misguided and ineffective in terms of the stated policy goals, and that they will result in the further stigmatization of individuals who engage in sex work and of persons living with HIV. Punitive approaches to regulating sex work have proven ineffective in reducing HIV transmission among people who provide sexual services and their clients. Further, publication of names, photographs and positive HIV status is a fundamental breach of confidentiality and exposes sex workers to stigma and violence. Such measures are likely to result in further discrimination and could lead to reduced access to the health services they need.”"

An excerpt from the letter read: “Human Rights Watch considers that the actions of the police, and of the Government, violate human rights protected under international law. They also are inconsistent with sound, ethical public health practice and will likely serve to undermine efforts to protect and promote public health.Detaining individuals in order to conduct forced medical procedures, including testing for HIV, violates the right to security of the person, a right guaranteed under both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 9) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 5). Forcible testing is also a violation of bodily integrity and autonomy. The UN’s expert health agencies have affirmed that HIV testing should only be done with informed consent, meaning testing must be both informed and voluntary; furthermore, testing should be accompanied by pre- and post-test counseling and the confidentiality of test results should be guaranteed. In addition, forcibly testing someone for HIV is a violation of both bodily integrity and privacy. Disclosing by press release that some of those detained by police have tested HIV-positive, which is medical information that should be held confidential, implicates all those who were detained and whose identities and photos were broadcast by the media. The disclosure exposes sex workers and others to potential violence. Such excessive invasions of privacy serve no legitimate objective.” The entire joint letter is available through the accompanying link."

There is no evidence that punitive approaches to regulating sex work are effective in reducing HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients. The initiation of criminal prosecution against sex workers living with HIV for intentional gross bodily harm raises concerns about the inappropriate application of criminal law, particularly in a context where clients have the social and economic power to insist upon condom use. In addition, publication of names, photographs and positive HIV status drive sex workers into hiding and reduces their trust in health care services. UNAIDS is further concerned by a recent amendment to immigration legislation adopted in April 2012 that appears to provide for automatic detention of migrants and asylum-seekers who have an infectious disease, or belong to a group at high risk of infection, without consideration of whether they pose an actual risk. This includes sex workers, people who inject drugs and could be applied to people living with HIV. To the degree the law assumes that people living with HIV, sex workers and people who use drugs pose a public health threat based only on their health and social status, it is overly broad and discriminatory, and represents an HIV-related restriction on entry, stay and residence.” The full press release is available for view through the accompanying link."

A report from the meeting informed that members of the CSF sent a “Letter to Commissioners Dalli and Reding expressing our concern with the alarming situation in Greece concerning discrimination and criminalisation of sex workers and migrants” that May. John Dalli was the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy between 2010 and 2012, and Viviane Reding was the European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship between 2010 and 2014. According to the report, two CSF members from Greece reported on the situation at the meeting: “Nikos [Dedes] explained how the new immigration law was implemented by the Greek centre for disease control and how the law on sex work is abused to criminalise sex workers and subduing them to forced HIV-testing. The disclosing of information is currently continuing. Marianella Kloka mentioned that civil society has complained to the data protection authority. Government officials declared that the practice of disclosing information would stop but this is not the case. Prosecution is continuing.” Wolfgang Philip, representative of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) of the European Commission, informed CFS participants that “Greece is organising a high level meeting in June on HIV and migration, with Health Ministers from neighbouring countries, ECDC, WHO, EC. ECDC was mandated to carry out a risk assessment mission in preparation of the meeting, which took place at the end of May.” and that the ‘Think Tank will look into developments in member states, starting with Greece”. As noted in the report, Yusef Azad, CSF representative from the Joint Technical Mission to Greece, added that “The EU mission report to Greece will be published mid June. ECDC cannot publish it, since this was a request from the European Commission. If it decides not to publish the report, civil society should push for it.” In the Action List from the minutes of the meeting, members of the CSF urged themselves to “Check if monitoring report on Greece is published by the EC - otherwise follow up with Commission to ensure publication” (Report of the 15th HIV/AIDS Civil Society Forum, Luxembourg, 4/5 June 2012). The report mentioned by the members of the CSF was published jointly by European Center for Disease Control, Fundamental Rights Agency, European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug and Addiction and World Health Organisation, Europe, in December 2012."

Several of the informants familiar with the events that occurred in pre-trial detention reported during interviews of at least one collective attempt at suicide. The women who were hired to clean the cells were unwilling to clean up the blood that followed from this event because they, like the majority of prison guards, were ignorant about the modes of transmission of the virus. These and other forms of stigmatisation and discrimination were a result, including the use of gloves to touch the women and the plates on which they were served. This attempt at suicide might be viewed as an act of dissent under such conditions of extremely limited autonomy and agency."

While calling for governments to “[d]ecriminalise private and consensual adult sexual behaviours, including same-sex sexual acts and voluntary sex work” (Global Commission on HIV and the Law 2012: 7-10), the Global Commission stressed that “[u]nfortunately, decriminalisation sometimes replaces punishment with regulation, which in its details is enforced through criminal law. Greece, Latvia and parts of Australia all have mandatory and forced medical testing, a human rights abuse and thus a form of punishment.” (ibidem: 41)."

According to the minister, the operation’s twofold purpose was to ‘restore order and security’ in the centre of Athens and to ‘close the country’s borders’ to flows of lathrometanastes (illegal immigrants) from Asia and Africa . ‘Operation Xenios Zeus’ initiated document checks in the streets of Athens (and other areas of the country), during which people were stopped on the basis of racial profiling and ethnic difference, their documents were checked, several people were taken to police stations and those without residence permits were transferred to detention centres.” (Rozakou 2017: 197).

Dendias stressed that ‘We do not care about the color, ethnicity, religion of the illegals. The only criterion is the compliance with legality, with full respect for human rights....’A key tactic of Operation Xenios Zeus is the use of existing general police powers to conduct identity checks to verify the legal status of individuals presumed to be irregular migrants.

One publication introduced the programme as follows: \"The ARISTOTLE programme was initiated in August 2012, in collaboration with the National and Kapodestrian University of Athens and OKANA and it enjoys the support of NGOs (PR.A.K.S.I.S., POSITIVE VOICE). The aim of the programme is to intervene in communities of injecting drug users in the centre of Athens, in order to identify IDUs, to examine and refer them to the Infectious Diseases Units in case they are found HIV-positive after consensual examination. The programme is bound to be completed in five cycles. So far, the results of the first four cycles have been published. By way of illustration, ARISTOTLE has examined 3.007 individual users so far, with 523 (17.4%) having been found HIV-positive, and half of them having been diagnosed as positive for the first time. At this point, it should be noted that all users that are found HIV-positive are granted full priority on the waiting list for admission to substitution treatment units, if they wish to do so. Equally impressive were two additional findings of the first four cycles of the programme: more than 30% of IDUs who were diagnosed as HIV-positive were homeless, whereas more than 80% are co-infected with hepatitis C.\" (Kloka 2014, 3) "

This letter was likely a response to the Joint Letter to UN Special Rapporteur on Health by the European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG), Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Positive Voice. \"We have the honour to address you in our capacities as Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants; and Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 15/22, 17/12, and 16/33. In this connection, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency’s Government information we have received regarding the increase in xenophobic and racist attacks, the entry for the first time into Parliament of the far right wing political party Golden Dawn, as well as the implementation of policy measures targeting migrants and asylum seekers in the area of health including the mandatory medical testing and administrative detention of migrants and asylum seekers based on health status. These incidents and developments illustrate a worrying general pattern of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia against foreign nationals, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees which is emerging in Greece....It was also reported that an amendment to article 13 of Presidential Decree 114/2010 on the establishment of a single procedure for granting refugee status or subsidiary protection to aliens or to stateless persons was adopted in April 2012 (Law 4075/11.04.2012). The amendment reportedly provides for detention of migrants and asylum seekers if they represent a “danger to public health”, when they “suffer from an infectious disease”, “belong to groups vulnerable to\" infectious diseases” (assessment is permissible on the basis of country of origin, status as an intravenous drug user or a sex worker), and are living in “conditions that do not meet minimum standards of hygiene”. The amendment allegedly requires mandatory health examinations and appropriate hospitalization for individuals in these categories. It was also alleged that the amendment was formally justified on grounds that high concentration of irregular migrants, particularly in Athens and other major urban centres, creates serious risks to public health considering the living conditions of migrants and the infectious diseases prevalent in their home countries...We would also like to refer to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance regarding the responsibility that political leaders and political parties have in refraining from disseminating discourses that scapegoat vulnerable groups, condemning all political messages that disseminate ideas based on racial superiority or hatred and that incite racial discrimination or xenophobia, and promoting multiculturalism, tolerance, mutual understanding and respect with their societies (A/HRC/20/38)...And finally, the right to health contains both freedoms, including from interference and non-consensual medical treatment, and entitlements, including the right to a system of health protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest attainable level of health (para.8).”"

The agenda, report and individual presentations from national representatives from the conference are available for view through the accompanying link. According to the agenda, the objectives of the meeting were to: “continue information exchange between countries to support the response to the current HIV outbreaks in Greece and Romania, to prevent the acceleration of HIV infections among people who inject drugs in these and other countries and to strengthen the capacity of all participating countries to monitor and prevent HIV infections in this population. To achieve its objective, the meeting will provide a series of presentations which: (1) Review the current epidemiological situation with respect to the HIV among people who inject drugs and the potential risk for acceleration of HIV transmission due to coverage of prevention services and changing drug use patterns among people who inject drugs. (2) Share experiences in controlling outbreaks among people who inject drugs and review the opportunities and challenges with respect to: i) surveillance and monitoring; ii) harm reduction interventions; iii) drug treatment for people who inject drugs; and iv) integration of responses and collaboration between public health and drugs authorities to maximize the efficacy of prevention interventions.” (EMCDDA 2012, Agenda from meeting)"

In his conclusions, the Ombudsman states among others that: Investigation is required as to whether the provision was preceded by reasoned opinions or recommendations by scientific bodies, which documented the risks for public health grom communicable diseases and microbial infections and indicated the application of sanitary controls in specific population groups; It is questioned whether HIV and hepatitis B and C fall into the category of infectious diseases that are dangerous to public health, given that they are mainly spread through unprotected sex or sharing needles. From the perspective of the principle of proportionality, the necessity of compulsory measures is questioned, in connection with the exhaustion of moderate measures that were implemented until then and proved ineffective in protecting public health\" (Kloka 2014, 4-5).

The newly-formed government which comprised three parties (New Democracy, Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement and Democratic Left) proceeded to changes in the political leadership of the Ministry of Health. The portfolio of public health changed hands and was assigned to Foteini Skopouli. The pressure coming from abroad was intensified, when international organizations and NGOs realized that this was the ideal moment to inform the new Deputy Minister of Health for the abovementioned health provision and its impact.” (Kloka 2014, 4).

Results of this research were published in December of 2012, a few days before the workshop on Greek Justice, Legislation and HIV/AIDS organised by the Positive Voice. According to the report, 80 % of respondents were in favour of this decision despite the obvious rights violations. At least one interviewee suggested that this research might have been planned well in advance of the initial testings and arrests. Others suggested that it designed to justify and legitimise the actions undertaken by KEELPNO in 2012."

Some statistical information suggests the risks of the epidemic in Greece moving to mirror the epidemic in neighbouring countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In those countries the major vector for HIV is injecting drug use. There is no more efficient way to pass HIV than by direct injection into the bloodstream. The use and reuse of infected needles is highly risky in this respect. The IJUs reflect the sexuality of the majority population. It is therefore vital to nip in the bud the growth of this risky mode of transmission. Attempts to stamp out all drug use have not succeeded. Harm reduction is a much more effective and sensible option; Likewise, in Greece, sex workers are often disempowered. They are disrespected, at least in public discourse, largely because of religious and social stigma towards them. The well known event in April/May 2012, in which sex workers in Athens were arrested, photographed and had their personal data (including HIV positive findings) widely publicised, on the supposed ground of protecting public health, is a shocking and counterproductive course of conduct. It is likely to drive sex workers underground and to place them outside the reach of healthcare messages and protective strategies.” This speech was made available on the website of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, which is accessible via the link below."

These applications relied on Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights with the arguments that: (1) the women were subjected to compulsory HIV testing whilst under withdrawal from drugs and on police premises, in disregard of the recommended HIV protocol, and (2) the women were denied adequate medical care and hygienic conditions while in detention by the General Police Directorate of Athens, which all amounted to humiliating and degrading treatment. Additionally, applications were based on Article 13 of the Convention, as the lawyers argued that the claimants did not have access to a lawfully effective remedy before a national authority, and on Article 5 of the Convention due to the unlawful detention of the implicated women.

It was a collective trial of 3 women, none of whom were aware of their positive HIV status at the moment of the arrests, and none of whom went to rehabilitation or substitution programmes in lieu of pre-trial detention. A second trial of 5 women took place in March 2013. All of the women were accused of attempted bodily harm and the illegal provision of sexual services. All women were acquitted of these charges. In interviews, representatives of the team of lawyers explained that they relied on a legal theory known as self-endangerment, meaning that one must take responsibility for acts that might put themselves in danger, and on UNAIDS guidelines on the criminalisation of HIV transmission, which were published around the same time."

She was initially sentenced for both attempted bodily harm and illegal involvement in sex work in the first and second instances. However, she was ultimately acquitted of all charges upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Greece thanks to the evidence that was laid down in the UNAIDS Guidelines, and the health booklet that was maintained by the accused, which proved that she was on effective treatment and posed only very minimal risk of transmitting the virus to her clients.."

Sapounas -the doctor who performed forcible tests on behalf of the Greek Centre for Disease Control/KEELPNO- was in breach of the law, and that their arrest by police officers was based on insufficient evidence. The court also made the unprecedented judgement that the women’s mugshots must be removed from websites where they have been posted since 2012 along with names, dates of birth and other personal data following original publication on the website of the Greek police. In his closing argument, the prosecutor Ioannis Panagopoulos recommended the women’s acquittal saying that the authorities responsible for the operation exceeded the limits of proportionality in the protection of public health.”"

The prosecutor at the trial said there was no evidence to suggest the women worked as prostitutes nor that they had unprotected sex with people, with the exception of one of the defendants. The women had been arrested back in 2012 for allegedly working illegally as prostitutes and their names were publicized, causing outrage among rights groups. They were arrested after the health minister at the time, Andreas Loverdos, called for the criminalization of unprotected sex with prostitutes. The women had always maintained their innocence and people in the courtroom broke out in loud applause once the verdict was read out.”"

Following her arrest, she faced criminal charges for grievous bodily harm and was subjected to pre-trial detention in Koridallos prison. She was not placed in the same ward as all of the other arrested women, and she was released after several months. She was initially convicted of attempted bodily harm in the first instance, and then later contacted the inter-organisational alliance for support.

A rational application of criminal law in the context of HIV should reflect this general position. In particular, it should be guided by the following considerations and recommendations”: with regard to the assessment of the harm caused by HIV, the risk of HIV transmission, and the mental culpability of the person accused; with regard to the determination of defences to prosecution or conviction; with regard to the assessment of elements of proof; with regard to the determination of penalties following conviction for HIV non-disclosure, exposure or transmission; and with regard to prosecutorial guidelines.

All people, however; not only drug users and female sex workers have rights; everyone has rights. The existence of the health decree is necessary in order to determine the rules based on which everyone’s rights will be respected: the rights of both those vulnerable social groups we want to protect primarily because they are [vulnerable] and the rights of the rest of the population to feel safe and to know that public health is being protected.”"

This raised a number of concerns about breaches of confidentiality of personal health data, imposition of criminal charges based on HIV status and discrimination. The Greek Ombudsman said that publishing the photos and personal data of the HIV positive women ‘not only violates rights inextricably linked to the respect of human dignity and status of the patient but is also an ineffective means of prevention and protection of public health’. On 20 April 2012, the European Commission asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to perform a risk assessment mission on the HIV situation in Greece.

This regulation would roll back the significant advances that have been made in fighting the HIV epidemic in Greece, the region, and globally. This policy will further marginalize people, including people who inject drugs, sex workers and undocumented migrants, who are already stigmatized and criminalized in many societies and have little to no access to HIV, prevention and treatment services. Health Regulation No. GY/39A contradicts its intended impact. Instead of encouraging people to come forward voluntarily for an HIV test, it will discourage them from seeking the treatment and care that people living with HIV need. Good public health measures take into account not only epidemiology but also human rights. GY30A contravenes the human rights of Greek people and will, therefore, have a negative effect on their public health. Finally, this regulation is deeply worrying as it gives the police the authority to assist in enforcing this policy, including isolation, restriction quarantine, hospitalization, and treatment. We are appalled by this measure as it violates bodily integrity and autonomy. Moreover, there is a global consensus amongst the leading international and global health institutions that firmly assert that mandatory HIV testing is incongruent with public health and human rights. The initial introduction and implementation of this regulation in April 2012 has already deterred people at risk of HIV from seeking testing and services. The reinstatement, Health Regulation No. GY39/A will fuel the HIV epidemic through the stigma and fear it will create. We urge the Greek government to respect the human rights and interests of its citizens by repealing this regulation immediately.”"

There is no evidence that punitive approaches—particularly those that single out members of key populations––are effective in responding to HIV. On the contrary, such measures deter people most affected by HIV from accessing lifesaving HIV prevention and care services. Initially introduced in April 2012, the Sanitary Decree allows for ‘specific control’ and ‘screening’ measures against sex workers, migrants and people who use drugs. Shortly after the Decree was introduced a number of sex workers were arrested, detained, tested for HIV, prosecuted and their photographs published. The Sanitary Decree was repealed in April 2013; however, the government reintroduced the Decree in June this year. UNAIDS is very concerned that the reintroduction of this legislation, with the same provisions, could serve to justify actions that violate human rights. UNAIDS urges the Greek authorities to repeal the Sanitary Decree and initiate dialogue with health experts, civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders to develop appropriate evidence-informed and rights-based public health regulations. All people—including sex workers and their clients, people who use drugs, migrants and asylum-seekers—should have access to voluntary and confidential HIV services and be protected against discrimination.” The full text is available through the accompanying link."

RUA team has core members (cis and trans female and male) who work or have worked in different areas of sex industry as well as people living with HIV/HCV/HBV, and/or using or have used psychoactive substances.” A more detailed presentation of the project is available through the accompanying link."

Delegates unanimously agreed on the urgent necessity to change the current legal framework that restricts the rights of sex workers. The Conference was the first opportunity since 2004 to discuss the need to reform the current legislation on sex work. Although the current legislation allows sex work on premises, there are various obstacles to obtain a legal work permit. In the Attica region for example only 5-10 workplaces out of 500 have this permit. It is noteworthy that the conference was organized with the official support of the Greek Ministry of Interior. The Minister of Interior himself, Mr Skourletis, spoke of the need to examine all the social and cultural factors of the country as well as to study other models to effectively legislate on such a critical social issue as sex work.” The rest of a report from the conference is available through the link below."
