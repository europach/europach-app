  body: 'The ‘Harm Reduction in Poland’ policy map presents important events and processes that shaped harm reduction developments since the 1980s. The map focuses on the history of criminalization of drug use in the context of HIV epidemic and the political and economic transformation (taking place in Poland since 1989). It also shows how both humanitarian and security logics (often in entangled forms) were used to develop and sustain an abstinence-only approach and criminalization of illicit drugs as a dominant policy response to drug use. The map also investigates ways of self-organizing of people who use drugs, by demonstrating how on the basis of mutual-help logic they claimed access to health and to harm reduction services.',
