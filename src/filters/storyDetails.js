  title: 'Germany: HIV/AIDS, Prisons and the De/Criminalisation of Harm Reduction',
  researcher: 'Friederike Faust',
  body: 'This story sheds light on the contested political domain of harm reduction in prison settings. As in many countries, prisoners are among those social groups most impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Germany, and needle sharing among people who inject drugs in prisons has been identified as the most important route of transmitting the virus. As a result, implicated activists, advocates, social workers and self-help organisations have sought to make sterile injection equipment available to prisoners since the earliest days of the epidemic. This story is centred around a specific case from 1995: After much debate, the parliament of the state of Berlin decided to initiate syringe exchange programmes in selected prisons. Prior to this decision, civil society groups, transnational governing bodies and professional associations had put pressure on the German government with acts of civil disobedience, legal pursuits, and advocacy activities. At the same time, strong opposition emerged from select politicians, and from certain authorities and employees of the prison system. The provision of harm reduction in prisons continues to provoke controversy until today.',

  title: 'UK: Police Safety, Spit Hoods and HIV Criminalisation in England and Wales',
  researcher: 'Emily Nicholls',
  body: 'This story is concerned with the criminalisation of HIV transmission in the UK and takes as its starting point a Witness Seminar on the topic held by the UK component of EUROPACH. The story includes various attempts to review and reform the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 – the act under which HIV transmission is criminalised – as well as various interventions by civil society into the investigation and prosecution of cases. As the story follows the connections made by those participating in the meeting, it also highlights the ways in which the criminalisation of HIV transmission touches and is entangled with other policy areas.',

  title: 'Poland: Harm Reduction and the Criminalisation of Drug Use',
  researcher: 'Justyna Struzik',
  body: 'This story presents important events and processes that have shaped harm reduction policies, in particular opioid substitution treatment, in Poland since the 1980s. Under the backdrop of the political and economic transformation that has taken place in Poland since 1989, this story focuses on the history of the criminalisation of drug use in Poland in relation to the growing HIV epidemic among people who use drugs. It shows how a variety of logics have been put to use in the development of an abstinence-only approach, the criminalisation of illicit drugs, and a self-help movement of people who use drugs in the country.',

  title: 'Europe: The Intersecting Criminalisation of HIV, Sex Work, Migration and Drug Use',
  researcher: 'Agata Dziuban and Todd Sekuler',
  body: 'In the spring of 2012, as Greece was in the midst of a financial crisis and working with the European Union to manage an emerging HIV epidemic among people who use drugs, several hundreds of women were forcibly tested for HIV in the capital city of Athens. Alleged to be sex workers and many of them using drugs, those women who tested positive were arrested, charged with repeated intentional grievous bodily harm and their names and photographs were posted to the police department’s website. This story documents these events, which triggered an organised response by a range of local and transnational activist and non-governmental organisations that included public protests, letter writing initiatives, visits to the prison and women’s families, and legal and psychological support. Although the national courts came to dismiss a lawsuit brought against both the medical doctors who forcibly tested the women and the police for violating the women’s right to keep their HIV status private, the case against the Greek state was ultimately brought to the European Court of Human Rights by a volunteer group of lawyers and thirteen of the women who they came to represent.',

  title: 'Turkey: Marriage, the State and the Criminalisation of HIV Transmission',
  researcher: 'Zülfukar Çetin',
  body: 'In 1998, a wife brought her husband to court for attempted murder after she learned that he was living with HIV and then testing positive for the virus herself. Given that couples are required by law to undergo health examinations by public health institutions prior to getting married, she also brought a case against the Turkish state for granting him permission to wed. This story documents this first court case involving the criminalisation of HIV transmission in Turkey, which involved three different court proceedings that spanned the course of eight years. Although he was ultimately found to be guilty of attempted murder, the husband ended up serving no prison sentence due to his infection with HIV and need for treatment, which he argued was not adequately available in prisons in the country at the time.',
