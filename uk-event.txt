The new regulations extend these charges to community healthcare services and place a requirement that NHS trusts ascertain a patient's eligibility for free care by checking passports or other documents and charging up front where applicable. The briefing suggests that these checks on eligibility may also be applicable where care is not chargeable (e.g. HIV), and whether or not this is revealed to be the case, it may act as a deterrent for undocumented migrants to access healthcare. In addition, the extension of charges to drug and alcohol services is likely to reduce access to harm reduction strategies.`
